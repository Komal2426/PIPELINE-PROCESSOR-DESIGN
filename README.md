The Pipeline Processor is an advanced digital architecture designed to improve processing speed and efficiency by dividing the instruction execution process into multiple stages. Each stage performs a specific part of an instruction, allowing multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously — one in each stage — like an assembly line.In this project, a basic 5-stage pipeline processor was designed and simulated using the Cadence tool. The design implements the fundamental stages of instruction execution: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, and Write Back. Each stage is synchronized using clock cycles to ensure smooth instruction flow and reduce overall execution time.The simulation in Cadence SimVision verified correct data flow between stages and confirmed that the pipeline architecture achieves instruction-level parallelism, thereby enhancing the processor’s performance compared to a non-pipelined design.
